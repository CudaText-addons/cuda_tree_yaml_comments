Code-Tree helper for YAML lexer.
It finds all single-line comments in the YAML file, and shows comments
in the CudaText code-tree. Suitable for game resources, which have lot of
single-line comments.

Originally was posted to the CudaText forum, but forum crashed after that,
so Alexey Torgashin wants to keep the code in GitHub.
